# Binary Tree Project

## Introduction

This is a Java project that implements a Binary Tree data structure and provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with the tree. The program allows you to insert, remove, search for elements, and print the tree according to various orders.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An integrated development environment (IDE) or a Java compiler
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a simple menu that allows you to perform various operations on the binary tree. Here are the available options:

1. **Insert:** Add a number to the binary tree.
2. **Remove:** Remove a number from the binary tree.
3. **Search:** Check if a number is present in the binary tree.
4. **Print:** Print the binary tree in different orders (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order).

To navigate the menu, enter the corresponding option number. Follow the prompts to input the required information, such as the number to insert, remove, or search. The program will provide feedback on the success of the operation.
